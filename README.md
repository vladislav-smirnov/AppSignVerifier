# App Signature Verifier

**App Signature Verifier** is a utility library for Android that provides tools to verify various properties of applications, such as checking if an app is signed by the system, if it is a privileged app, or if it resides in the system partition. The library is designed following Clean Architecture principles to ensure modularity, testability, and maintainability.

---

## Features

- Check whether an app:
  - Is signed with a system signature.
  - Is a privileged app.
  - Resides in the system partition.
- Modular and extensible design.
- Built for modern Android development with Kotlin.

## Setup

To add this library to your Android project, follow these steps:

1. **Add the dependency to your `build.gradle` file:**

   ```gradle
   dependencies {
       implementation 'io.github.airdaydreamers:appsignverifier:xxx'
   }
   ```

2. **Sync your project with Gradle files.**

## Usage

This library offers simple, intuitive methods for verifying application properties. Detailed documentation and examples are available to help you integrate the library into your project seamlessly.

```kotlin
// Example usage
val isSystemApp = context.isSystemApp()
val isSignedBySystem = context.isSignedBySystem()
val isPrivileged = context.isPrivilegedApp()
val isInSystemPartition = context.isAppInSystemPartition()
```
